        # Portals would be called 'exits' if that didn't make it
        # perilously easy to exit the program by mistake. They link
        # one place to another. They are one-way; if you want two-way
        # travel, make another one in the other direction. Each portal
        # has a 'weight' that probably represents how far you have to
        # go to get to the other side; this can be zero. Portals are
        # likely to impose restrictions on what can go through them
        # and when. They might require some ritual to be performed
        # prior to becoming passable, e.g. opening a door before
        # walking through it. They might be diegetic, in which case
        # they point to a Thing that the player can interact with, but
        # the portal itself is not a Thing and does not require one.
        # 
        # These are implemented as methods, although they
        # will quite often be constant values, because it's not much
        # more work and I expect that it'd cause headaches to be
        # unable to tell whether I'm dealing with a number or not.
